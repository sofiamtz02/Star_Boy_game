# Star_Boy_game
----
This game is about a Boy named Bob. Bob lived in a world in which only the color green existied, but he wanted more...
Yet not every wish goes as we planned, and so he wished for more colors but a shooting star ended up crashing on to him.... YIKES. That lead him to being in his sketchbook with his drawings in different colors. 
So, be carful what you wish for.

## Game Play
There are 3 levels, red, yellow and black. Each level has its own monsters, and each one is more difficult than the last. 
To play, you must move within the map by jumping on to platforms without falling or else you will die. You must also avoide being hit or touched by said montsers, or you will also die. The mosters will be coming from the left and right directions, altho watch out as some will move diagonaly across the map. 

The score is based on the time the player stays alive, and when they die a game over scene will pop up, telling them their score including options of going to the menu, the levels or to play again. The scores are saved, but the player can view their highest score of each level by pressing the 'highscore' button at the main menu.
